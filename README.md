# Intro

Bash aliases are a shortened version of a larger command. Typing long commands can get a little monotonous if it's part of your regular workflow so using aliases helps to save time and reduce stress. This repository is a collection of popular aliases to help simplify your life.

# Usage

To use these aliases in your own terminal you will need to save them into the `.bash_aliases` file in your users root directory. If the `.bash_aliases` file doesn't already exist you can create it with the `touch` command. You could also use the `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` files.. depending on your operating system.

You can look at the explanations for each alias in the associated README and then copy and paste the desired aliases onto your own system. Please feel free to contribute some of your own aliases if you find something's missing.
